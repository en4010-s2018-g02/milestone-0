	For the prototype our group has created pages that reflect both a mobile and desktop view. The application will have three views depending on the users access level. The user levels given from the project benefactor are Super Admin, Admin, TA, and Student. From the Super Admin page, the Super Admin will be able to schedule classes for lab time, grant Admin and TA access, and grant or revoke user privilege. From the Admin page, Admins are able to import class rosters, add a TA for the class, and schedule time for the class to use the lab. For the TA view, the TA is able to review the active students in the lab and is able to grant users more time and is able to end the students session in the lab. Students will be identified through their z number and will be checked against a database of allowed users. If the student is allowed to use the lab the student is then required to verfiy the condition of the workbench and equipment by looking at a picture taken by the last user of the workbench. If the workbench matches the condition of the picture then the user will have to also agree to the lab usage rules and will then be granted time on the workbench. After the users time is finished, the user will be required to take a picture of the workbench to used as verification. Users are also able to request more time and are able to end their lab session early. Users are also able to report the conditions of workbenches by navigating to the report page and submitting a request. Reporting a workbench requires that the user takes a picture of the workbench and allows the user to write a small description about the issues with the workbench.
